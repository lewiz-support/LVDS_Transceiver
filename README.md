This repository is for releasing the LVDS transceiver design to open source.
The initial version targets the open source Skywater 130nm silicon process.

We hope this is useful to people whether to develop it further or learning analog development.
We hope that someone will take it to the next step of layout, fab, test the design and report back to the open source with results.
We also hope you will contribute to further advancing the design for the open source community.
Analog design is difficult!
so we hope this is useful.

What we have done:
- design it (based on a previous work which is noted in the DOC)
- done the schematic
- build the Spice stack
- simulate it
- tune it for performance for 1Gbps for all cases (over silicon process)
- wrote the docs and provide the results
